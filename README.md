# 🕯️ THE CHURCH OF REFACTORING ⛪

> *“Legacy is original sin. Clean code is redemption.”*

---

**The Church of Refactoring** is a sacred order devoted to the exorcism of code smells, the sanctification of architecture, and the ritual purification of legacy sins.

We preach the gospel of **SOLID**, enforce **strict linting**, and accept **no false abstractions**.

🔥 Here,  
- Methods are made pure  
- Names are given meaning  
- `switch` statements are cast into the void  

---

## ✨ Our Sacred Rites

- 🩸 **Sacrificial Renamings** — for when `foo` must finally find its purpose  
- 🧾 **Immutable Confessions** — embrace functional truth and pure functions  
- ✝ **Blessed Rebases** — rewrite history, but holier  
- 🕊️ **Semantic Rebirth** — commit with intent, or not at all

## 📜 Commandments of the Church

1. **Thou shalt not push to main without ritual tests**
2. **Thou shalt respect the Law of Least Responsibility**
3. **No code shall be written without linting penance**
4. **Every class shall have purpose, every method a meaning**
5. **Refactor often, merge cleanly, commit meaningfully**
